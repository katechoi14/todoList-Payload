todoList is a website created with NextJS, using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. 
This web application introduces users to a simple and easy to-do list for their daily tasks.

The five functionalities of todoList are:
1. **Add** task with task name, username (the name of the person to complete the task), and the date it must be completed by.
2. **Done?** to cross off the whole task once it's completed.
3. **Delete** to get rid of any task if not needed anymore.
4. **Editing** tasks as needed.
5. **Toggling around** tasks to set priority.
